statistical season since his rookie year with the indianapolis colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. although the team had a 7–0 start, manning led the nfl in interceptions. in week 10, manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. he set the nfl's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback brock osweiler, who took over as

wrote one of the most valuable islamic works on pharmacology, entitled kitab al-saydalah ( the book of drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. he devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in the canon of medicine. of great impact were also the works by al-maridini of baghdad and cairo, and ibn al-wafid ( 1008–1074), both of which were printed in latin more than fifty times,
