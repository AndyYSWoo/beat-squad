plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. in at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the

sidebranches. the tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles ( chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. the function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. in addition to colloblasts, members of the genus haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids:

"european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. according to the treaty on european union articles 9 and 10, the eu observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". in practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament can not initiate legislation against the commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the council are required to legislate. the justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the european economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the eu developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. over time, this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all european member states: under teu article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the commission with one million signatures. tfeu article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the parliament on issues which affect them. parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote", "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf1": "one million signatures", "572651f9f1498d1400e8dbf0": "every five years", "572945b11d0469140077922f": "1 february 2007",

pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. for every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. however, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. these tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no
